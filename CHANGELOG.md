# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed
- **aioimaplib 2.x compatibility** (Home Assistant 2025.x/2026.x ship 2.0.1): the IDLE loop awaited the synchronous `idle_done()` and crashed with `'NoneType' object can't be awaited` on every server push, so new mails were never picked up; it now uses the future returned by `idle_start()` and calls `idle_done()` synchronously.
- SEARCH/FETCH were issued while an IDLE was pending; the server does not answer until DONE, so `scan_now` and reconnect scans failed with an empty `CommandTimeout`. Every command now leaves IDLE first and runs under a lock shared with the IDLE loop.
- Config and options flows could not be rendered by Home Assistant's form serializer (`vol.All([vol.In(...)])`) → "Unknown error occurred" after the IMAP step. Both flows now use `cv.multi_select` and validate that at least one domain is selected.

### Changed
- Notification mails from every Amazon sender on a configured domain are accepted (`order-update@`, `shipment-tracking@`, `auto-confirm@`, `ship-confirm@`, `delivery-update@`), and the IMAP search matches the domain; language is derived from the sender's domain.
- Error logs use `%r` so exceptions without a message (e.g. `CommandTimeout`) are still identifiable.
- `requirements`: `aioimaplib>=2.0.0`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-08

- HA services: `scan_now` (manual IMAP email scan) and `remove_package` (remove package from store)
- 19 bundled carrier logo SVGs in `static/carrier-logos/`
- Coordinator test coverage (9 tests)
- Sensor test coverage (15 tests)
- Ruff linting in CI with custom rule config
- Pre-commit hooks (ruff check+format, trailing whitespace, YAML/JSON validation)
- pyproject.toml (replaces pytest.ini + requirements.txt)
- Basedpyright type-checking in CI
- Coverage reporting with pytest-cov + codecov upload
- MIT LICENSE file
- SECURITY.md with private vulnerability reporting instructions
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (Contributor Covenant v2.0)
- CONTRIBUTING.md with dev setup and PR process
- .github/FUNDING.yml (GitHub Sponsors, Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee)

- Pull request template with checklist
- .github/dependabot.yml for pip and GitHub Actions
- "Open in HACS" button in README

- AGENTS.md knowledge base (root + 4 subdirectories)

### Changed
- Bumped minimum Home Assistant version from 2024.1.0 to 2025.6.0
- Pass `config_entry=entry` explicitly to DataUpdateCoordinator (required since HA 2026.8)
- Overhauled README: 8 badges, domain table, options table, carrier logos guide, debug guide
- Manifest keys sorted alphabetically (hassfest requirement)
- Removed root-level manifest.json (caused phantom integration in hassfest)
- hacs.json: removed deprecated `domains` and `iot_class` keys
- Brand icon added for HACS validation

### Fixed
- Sensor leak: AmazonPackageSensor entities are now removed when packages leave the active list
- Card memory leak: both Lovelace cards now unsubscribe from `state_changed` in `disconnectedCallback`
- Locale-dependent IMAP date: `build_imap_search_query` now hardcodes English month abbreviations instead of using `strftime`
- Private attribute access: coordinator uses `ImapClient.is_connected` property instead of `_client`
- Italian emails from amazon.it now parse correctly (were falling back to English defaults)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added
- Amazon Canada (amazon.ca) domain support
- Canada Post carrier tracking patterns

### Fixed
- Issue #1: Multi-domain selection was already implemented; amazon.ca added as selectable domain
- Issue #3: 404 login page error (from old web scraping) and duplicate unique IDs (old format without entry_id) — both resolved by IMAP email parsing migration
- Issue #4: Amazon Canada support added as requested

- Per-package sensors with status, tracking number, carrier, delivery date
- Aggregate "pending packages" sensor
- Custom Lovelace cards: amazon-tracker-card, pending-packages-card
- UI-only configuration (no YAML)
- Persistent storage via HA Store API
- Forward-only status progression (ordered → shipped → out_for_delivery → delivered)
